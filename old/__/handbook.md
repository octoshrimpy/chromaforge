## Houses & Class

2 x 1d6 gives you a choice for a primary house from two. 
rolling a 6 means you roll again, or pick a house manually. 
each house has 3 classes within.
from the two choices, pick which wil be your primary and secondary house
pick a class from your primary house
your secondary house gives you things you're good at (pros)
your class gives you things you're bad at (cons)

3, 5

3: arcana
5: charm

> we chose charm as primary, and arcana as secondary

the class you choose will add limits to the max level you can get certain houses to.
If the class has one house, that house is capped at level 5.
If it has 2 houses, they're both capped at level 7.
charm:
    hunter  ARC - capped at 5
    druid   ARC, STL - capped at 7
    bard    STL - capped at 5

> we chose hunter. hunters will not be allowed to level up Arcana past level 5


---
## Race Modifier

Race modifiers could change the color base of your character while adding House Points (see leveling up), allow you to roll for a secondary race, or just give flavortext to your character.

take the individual digits of your race roll, and check the race modifiers table

3, 4

3: flameborn - RED, STR+1
4: earthkin - GRN CHR+1

> we chose flameborn

## Final character

Put together everything you just did in this order: `{racemod} {secondary house} {race} {class}`

Our final character is a Flameborn arcane hobbit hunter.
Low on strength (1d8), but high on charm (+1 House Point). 
not too great when it comes to Arcana (capped at level 5), 
but has put some effort into it on their secondary class (+1 House Point).

# Skill Checks

Checks fall within one of the 5 houses. 
The DM picks the house and skill level required, but players can rationalize other houses to the DM.
Checks use 1d10 unless specified otherwise by character creation.
Permanence points are added to the rolls.
Successful skill checks have a house attached to them, and are non-transferrable across houses or players.
sk can be exchanged for xp and xp can be converted to Permanence Points. 

Every race has a good house (1d10+1) and a bad house (1d8)
    orcs are strong, but not charming
    goblins are stealthy but lack arcana knowledge
Race-based strengths give +2, while class-based strengths give +1
Every character attempting a check needs to roll. 
Group checks are only successful if everyone succeeds.
DC is the mimnimum the roll has to be to succeed.

If the character is rolling a check against a non-inanimate object, the DM needs to roll against them.
If the character's house is 5 or greater, the DM will roll a 1d20 intead of a 1d10.

See the SKill Checks table for more info.

 
=======================================================

# Leveling Up

Characters can only convert sk/xp/pp/orbs after a long rest, or before/after a session.
To level up, you need 3xp plus however many pp you have on that house:
    leveling up STL+4 needs 7 (3+4) STL xp
    leveling up CHR+1 needs 4 (3+1) CHR xp
Spirit Orbs can be used as currency in shops, or handed to other characters to use as xp.

 
=======================================================

# Traveling

Requires a skill check per player involved.
DM rolls 1d6 per player, that determines house. see traveling table.

 
=======================================================

# Combat

something here about counting offset from attacker and defender around the wheel,
and then attacking by using a different house than their color.

### Calculating attack

There are 3 kinds of attacks:
    air (jump & punch, flying creature)
    default (regular bar fight)
    exposed (if prone, pinned, crouched)
Attacking with air has advantage over defending default, and default has advantage over exposed
Air attacking default has +1 to any damage count.
Default attacking exposed has +1 to any damage count.
Air attacking exposed has +2 to any damage count.

### Calculating defense

There are 3 levels of defense:
    3: calculated
    2: default
    1: surprised

the defending party calculates `1d6+pp / 2` with the house that the attacker is using


### Death & Reviving

PCs faint, not die mid-combat. they die after post-fight mechanics are done. 
If a PC gets hit hard, they retain a negative HP value.
Each player may take a turn out of combat to attempt reviving a fainted player.
After a fight is over, each player that has at least 1HP may attempt to revive any fainted player.

Add 1d6 to the fainted player's health.
If HP goes positive, the player survives.
If revived player's HP is higher than 4, they may attempt reviving someone as well.

* races
    * add base HP
    * add descriptions
    * add pro/con houses
* classes
    * what if primary house had a max level of 12, or rolled with 12       
* combat
    figure out offset-based attacks for smarter combat
