# Style 

<!-- [ ] Tila you can put markdown style ideas in here for me/us to follow. -->

* `lists`       : Use a star, not a dash
* `line indents`: Use 4 spaces for indentation
* `split lines` : Use a space followed by a backslash
* `slashes`     : Wrap spash with spaces. Slash should not touch any other character

---

## Lists 

### Visual descriptions
<!-- @think: Refactor description for visual description priority  -->

When describing landmark items, list the features beginning with those that the characters would perceive at first glance, followed by those that require a closer inspection.

```md
1.  Altar stone 
    *   Sits atop a hill
    *   Surrounded by charred skeletons
    *   It has a crack through the middle
    *   Inscription describes a god that nobody worships
    *   It catches fire every solstice for 24 hours
```
