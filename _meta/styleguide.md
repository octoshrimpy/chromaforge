## Lists 

### Visual descriptions
<!-- @think: Refactor description for visual description priority  -->

 When describing landmark items, list the features beginning with those that the characters would perceive at first glance, followed by those that require a closer inspection.

```md
1.  Altar stone 
    *   Sits atop a hill
    *   Surrounded by charred skeletons
    *   It has a crack through the middle
    *   Inscription describes a god that nobody worships
    *   It catches fire every solstice for 24 hours
```
