what happened: 
  something happened, and the party was the only one to witness it all.
  the party has no recollection of it.
  everyone else alludes to the happenings with rumors and vague references.

what actually happened:
  the party blew themselves up across dimensions, causing an earth-shattering explosion, and appearing in the left-over crater. a few months later, a god came by and wiped their memory of it, in an attempt at slowly cleaning up the mess the party created in a different dimension.
