# premise

orc tribe, giving warriors to city as a tribute 
(stronger, so give gifts)

warriors are being cursed by some magic source  mid-travel
warriors get to city and immediately thrashed everything

city folk setting up to fight the orcs

PCs hired for figuring out orcs' location and count
avoid combat to avoid being traced back to village


_win condition_
stop the attacks, get the villagers to work together
need someone that speaks orc

> beat

A long time ago the orog leader of the orc tribe made a 
deal with the shaman of the nearby wood elf tribe to
send the orcs into a different plane of existence, so
that the two tribes do not fight for resources. The orog
has since died, and there has been no orog born since. 
orcs do not know how to read, so they do not know they are
in a separate plane. They found the portal that they initially
came through, assumed it was a doorway to a stronger people
(magic they don't understand, as it is elven), and are sending
warriors as gifts, hoping to befriend them in the only way they
know how.

after 900 years, this end of the portal evolved a plant named
clow, which is much stronger than the clow on the other side
of the portal. clow can be used for relaxation and mild 
hallucinations but on this end it causes paranoia, anxiety and
vivid hallucinations, as it is much more potent.

every time John goes through the portal, 
he goes back 1 in the transformation
