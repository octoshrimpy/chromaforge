all base stats are 1d10


whenever rolling for action, DM always rolls 1d10 while player rolls appropriate dice,
this will cause the general average of success to be higher or lower.
for actions where PC is more skilled, they will use a larger die + modifier points added in


there is no full levelup. players will spend spirit orbs towards base actions. 
these points will be added directly to rolls

=====================

actions that belong within PC's secondary class will have a 1d4 roll, where

* 1     0
* 2     1
* 3     2
* 4     3

=====================

base actions will always stem from these categories:

* strength
* stealth
* arcane
* range
* charm

sometimes an action might fit into two categories. 
pick the best fitting one and roll with it.

=====================

_example:_

PC: charming aquatic duarling artificer

situation:  
    attempting to talk their way out of getting arrested

base actions involved:
    charm

what to do: 
    charm is PC's secondary class.
    duarlings have 1d10 as the base charm dice
    roll 1d10 + 1d4
        1 (d10) + 3 (d4, worth 2)
        total action roll = 3
    DM rolls 1d10
        6 (d10)
    player failed the check
