## Houses & Class

2 x 1d6 gives you a choice for a primary house from two. 
rolling a 6 means you roll again, or pick a house manually. 
each house has 3 classes within.
from the two choices, pick which wil be your primary and secondary house
pick a class from your primary house
your secondary house gives you things you're good at (pros)
your class gives you things you're bad at (cons)

3, 5

3: arcana
5: charm

> we chose charm as primary, and arcana as secondary

the class you choose will add limits to the max level you can get certain houses to.
If the class has one house, that house is capped at level 5.
If it has 2 houses, they're both capped at level 7.
charm:
    hunter  ARC - capped at 5
    druid   ARC, STL - capped at 7
    bard    STL - capped at 5

> we chose hunter. hunters will not be allowed to level up Arcana past level 5


---
## Race Modifier

Race modifiers could change the color base of your character while adding House Points (see leveling up), allow you to roll for a secondary race, or just give flavortext to your character.

take the individual digits of your race roll, and check the race modifiers table

3, 4

3: flameborn - RED, STR+1
4: earthkin - GRN CHR+1

> we chose flameborn


---
## Final character

Put together everything you just did in this order: `{racemod} {secondary house} {race} {class}`

Our final character is a Flameborn arcane hobbit hunter.
Low on strength (1d8), but high on charm (+1 House Point). 
not too great when it comes to Arcana (capped at level 5), 
but has put some effort into it on their secondary class (+1 House Point).
