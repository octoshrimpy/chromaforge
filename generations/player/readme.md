# personality & background

Forge doesn't have built-in alignment charts, however now that you have your character built you can pick one if you'd like. 

# inventory & equipment

Inventory is simple: You have unlimited inventory slots, and can carry unlimited items or weight, _to a reasonable limit_. Your pack can't carry a whole dragon's gold stash, but you could feasibly use it to sneak a couple dragon eggs away from their clutch.

Equipment is much the same way as inventory. Sensible real-world logic and physics apply, unless there is a magical explanation.
