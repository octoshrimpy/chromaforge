# Skill Checks

Checks fall within one of the 5 houses. 
The DM picks the house and skill level required, but players can rationalize other houses to the DM.
Checks use 1d10 unless specified otherwise by character creation.
Permanence points are added to the rolls.
Successful skill checks have a house attached to them, and are non-transferrable across houses or players.
sk can be exchanged for xp and xp can be converted to Permanence Points. 


Every race has a good house (1d10+1) and a bad house (1d8)
    orcs are strong, but not charming
    goblins are stealthy but lack arcana knowledge


Every player has a primary house. Whenever rolling a check with that house, roll a 1d12 instead of a 1d10.
Race-based strengths give +2, while class-based strengths give +1
Every character attempting a check needs to roll. 
Group checks are only successful if everyone succeeds.
DC is the mimnimum the roll has to be to succeed.


If the character is rolling a check against a non-inanimate object, the DM needs to roll against them.
If the character's house is 5 or greater, the DM will roll a 1d20 intead of a 1d10.


See the SKill Checks table for more info.

# Leveling Up

Characters can only convert sk/xp/pp/orbs after a long rest, or before/after a session.
To level up, you need 3xp plus however many pp you have on that house:
* leveling up STL+4 needs 7 (3+4) STL xp
* leveling up CHR+1 needs 4 (3+1) CHR xp
Spirit Orbs can be used as currency in shops, or handed to other characters to use as xp.

# Traveling

Requires a skill check per player involved.
DM rolls 1d6 per player, that determines house. see traveling table.

# Combat

something here about counting offset from attacker and defender around the wheel,
and then attacking by using a different house than their color.

### Calculating attack

There are 3 kinds of attacks:
* `air` (jump & punch, flying creature)
* `default` (regular bar fight)
* `exposed` (if prone, pinned, crouched)
Attacking with `air` has advantage over defending `default`, and `default` has advantage over `exposed`
`Air` attacking default has +1 to any damage count.
`Default` attacking exposed has +1 to any damage count.
`Air` attacking exposed has +2 to any damage count.

### Calculating defense

There are 3 levels of defense:
1. surprised
2. default
3. calculated

the defending party calculates `1d6+pp / 2` with the house that the attacker is using


### Death & Reviving

PCs faint, not die mid-combat. they die after post-fight mechanics are done. 
If a PC gets hit hard, they retain a negative HP value.
Each player may take a turn out of combat to attempt reviving a fainted player.
After a fight is over, each player that has at least 1HP may attempt to revive any fainted player.

Add 1d6 to the fainted player's health.
If HP goes positive, the player survives.
If revived player's HP is higher than 4, they may attempt reviving someone as well.
