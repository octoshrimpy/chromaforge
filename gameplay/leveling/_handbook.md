# Leveling Up

Characters can only convert sk/xp/pp/orbs after a long rest, or before/after a session.
To level up, you need 3xp plus however many pp you have on that house:
    leveling up STL+4 needs 7 (3+4) STL xp
    leveling up CHR+1 needs 4 (3+1) CHR xp
Spirit Orbs can be used as currency in shops, or handed to other characters to use as xp.
