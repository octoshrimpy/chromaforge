# Combat

something here about counting offset from attacker and defender around the wheel,
and then attacking by using a different house than their color.

### Calculating attack

There are 3 kinds of attacks:
    air (jump & punch, flying creature)
    default (regular bar fight)
    exposed (if prone, pinned, crouched)
Attacking with air has advantage over defending default, and default has advantage over exposed
Air attacking default has +1 to any damage count.
Default attacking exposed has +1 to any damage count.
Air attacking exposed has +2 to any damage count.

### Calculating defense

There are 3 levels of defense:
    3: calculated
    2: default
    1: surprised

the defending party calculates `1d6+pp / 2` with the house that the attacker is using


### Death & Reviving

PCs faint, not die mid-combat. they die after post-fight mechanics are done. 
If a PC gets hit hard, they retain a negative HP value.
Each player may take a turn out of combat to attempt reviving a fainted player.
After a fight is over, each player that has at least 1HP may attempt to revive any fainted player.

Add 1d6 to the fainted player's health.
If HP goes positive, the player survives.
If revived player's HP is higher than 4, they may attempt reviving someone as well.
