house           - 10
bane house(s)   - 5, 7
main house      - 13
secondary house - 12



for every battle where the PC deals at least 1 damage, 
they will gain 1 experience point.

for every killing blow, the player will gain 1 spirit orb.

spirit orbs can be exchanged for experience points after a long rest. \
spirit orbs can be traded across players, and even used as currency.

3 experience points can be used to add a permanent +1 to any specific skill check.

1 experience point can be used to increase health permanently by 1

3 experience points can be used to create a single spirit orb after a long rest

---

Characters can only convert sk/xp/pp/orbs after a long rest, or before/after a session. \
To level up, you need 3xp plus however many pp you have on that house:

* leveling up `STL+4` needs **7** _(3+4)_ STL xp
* leveling up `CHR+1` needs **4** _(3+1)_ CHR xp

Spirit Orbs can be used as currency in shops, or handed to other characters to use as xp.


## Chapter 9 - Leveling Up

Any time you have three Skill Points (sk), you may exchange them for one Experience Point towards the house the checks were used towards.
After a long rest or before/after a session, you may convert any 3 House-specific XP into a House Permanent.

You may also convert any three XP into a Spirit Orb. These Orbs can be used as currency, or handed to other players/characters for them to use as experience. Be aware, one Spirit Orb will only give you one floating XP that you can add to any House, so there is a loss in the conversion.


   
at level 5, the world rolls against 
the player with 1d20 instead of 1d10

each class has a poor and very poor house. those houses are limited on the max level they can be raised to. 
poor maxes at level 7, very poor maxes at level 5. all other houses max out at level 10
