=======================================================

# Skill Checks

Checks fall within one of the 5 houses. 
The DM picks the house and skill level required, but players can rationalize other houses to the DM.
Checks use 1d10 unless specified otherwise by character creation.
Proficiency points are added to the rolls.
Successful skill checks have a house attached to them, and are non-transferrable across houses.
sk can be exchanged for xp and xp can be converted to Proficiency Points. 

Every race has one or two good houses and a bad house (1d8)

> orcs are strong, but not charming
> goblins are chaotic but lack basic knowledge

Race-based strengths give +2, while class-based strengths give +1

Every character attempting a check needs to roll. 
Group checks are only successful if mor ethan half of rolls succeed.
DC is the mimnimum the roll has to be to succeed.

If the character is rolling a check against a non-inanimate object, the DM needs to roll against them.
If the character's house is 5 or greater, the DM will roll a 1d20 intead of a 1d10.


_DC stands for difficulty class. Players need to roll that number or higher to pass the check. Any roll less than DC counts as 1 failed check._

## Chapter 6 - Skill Checks

Whenever a player attempts an action that could change the course of history or the world around them, an appropriate Skill Check is used. Every check falls within one of the 5 Houses, however players can rationalize using one house as opposed to another.

Every skill check uses a 1d10, unless stated otherwise in the racial traits. In those cases, use the mentioned die.

For every three successful Skill Checks in one house you get one Experience Point towards that House.
These XP points cannot be allocated anywhere else except for this one House.  

Skill checks are used to progress as a character in the game
when a character goes to on a mission or quest, it can be difficult to succeed at harder tasks.
Skill checks give a chance to level up abilities.

Every race has a strong and weak house. An Orc may be really strong (STR) but not as charming with words (CHR).

Race-based strengths are used by giving a permanent +2 to any rolls within that House.
Class-based strengths are accounted for by giving a permanent +1 to any rolls in that House.
Weaknesses are accounted for by having a smaller die being rolled.


Every character attempting the skill check needs to roll the appropriate die for their character.
The DM will determine which house the check will be ran against, players may persuade the DM on using a different house for their personal check.


Checks grant Skill Check Points (sk) when successful. They require a minimum of the DC rolled, and fail if that roll cannot be achieved within the fail count.

sometimes an action might fit into two categories. 
pick the best fitting one and roll with it.
