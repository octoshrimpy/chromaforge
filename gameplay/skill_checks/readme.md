# Skill Checks

Checks fall within one of the 5 houses. 
The DM picks the house and skill level required, but players can rationalize other houses to the DM.
Checks use 1d10 unless specified otherwise by character creation.
Permanence points are added to the rolls.
Successful skill checks have a house attached to them, and are non-transferrable across houses or players.
sk can be exchanged for xp and xp can be converted to Permanence Points. 

Every race has a good house (1d10+1) and a bad house (1d8)
    orcs are strong, but not charming
    goblins are stealthy but lack arcana knowledge
Race-based strengths give +2, while class-based strengths give +1
Every character attempting a check needs to roll. 
Group checks are only successful if everyone succeeds.
DC is the mimnimum the roll has to be to succeed.

If the character is rolling a check against a non-inanimate object, the DM needs to roll against them.
If the character's house is 5 or greater, the DM will roll a 1d20 intead of a 1d10.


_DC stands for difficulty class. 
Players need to roll that number or higher to pass the check. 
Any roll less than DC counts as 1 failed check._

race +2
race negative uses 1d8 (always on deficit)
class +1
3 xp to get +1 to any skill

requires 3 successful skill checks towards any skill per session to get one xp towards that skill

one skill check per person
