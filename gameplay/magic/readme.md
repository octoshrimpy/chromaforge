<!-- @todo this needs to have proper explanations on use, how it tires the user, etc -->
<!-- @todo: rethink this whole thing, separate list of spells and cantrips from this page. this is how magic works, not a list of magic stuff  -->

@todo :emma convert this to one sentence

Magic takes Stamina and Effort, including physical, mental, both, or otherwise. 

Energy cannot be created from nothing. Casting magic can make you sweat, cry, and bleed. Casting magic is the same as lifting weights: at first you don't know what you're doing and without good supervision, you may seriously hurt yourself. 

Magic is unpredictable at first, as it expresses itself differently through everyone. Magic requires maintenance. If casting irresponsibly, it can corrupt the caster towards any specific house colors. This causes them to bed out of tune with themselves, and be more easily distracted, hurt, tired, etc.

## cantrips
_3 cantrips per color_

#### defaults
* Range: self to 15'
* Time: level * 5 minutes

### yel
* Dancing lights
    * Creates one torch-sized light within range, making it appear as a torch, lantern, or glowing orb that hovers in the air for the duration. The light sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 10 feet to a new spot within range.
* Chill touch
    * You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it canâ€™t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.
* Decompose
    * You reach out and touch the corpse of a creature. Over the next minute, the corpse begins to rapidly decompose, sprouting fungus and moss as it begins to degrade into compost and mulch. An odd-colored flower or two may also spring from the corpse in this time. Applicable requirements for resurrection are unaffected by this decomposition.

## blu
* Encode thoughts
    * You pull a thought from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.

    * If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as Detect Thoughts or Modify Memory), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.

    * Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting Detect Thoughts on the strand has the same effect.)
* Guide
    * You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.
* Message
    * You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
    * 
    * You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

## prp
* Acid splash
    * You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature you can see within range, or choose two creatures you can see within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.

* Eldritch blast
    * A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.
    * 
* Poison spray
    * You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.

## red
* Shocking grasp
    * Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

    * The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
* Shillelagh
    * The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.
* Booming blade
    * You brandish the weapon used in the spellâ€™s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attackâ€™s normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.

## grn
* Blade ward
    * You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. Until the end of your next turn, you have resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by weapon attacks.
* Friends
    * For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at one creature of your choice that isnâ€™t hostile toward you. When the spell ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DMâ€™s discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.
* Message
    * You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

    * You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
