# Welcome to Chromaforge!

_**A lightweight, no-planning, as-long-as-you-want D&D campaign.**_

This repository contains everything you need to run anything from a one-shot to a full campaign, short of dice. 

_If you're reading this and a file is mentioned but not linked, or missing, please open an issue, drop a comment, ping me on discord, or reach out in some other way. Thank you for your help!_ :D

## Getting Started

Go through [Player Generation](./generations/player), and get your characters setup. 

Character sheets are in [/assets](./assets). 

You can print the character sheets or open up the html version in [assets/character_sheet.html](./assets/character_sheet.html). It ~~auto-saves~~ will auto-save to your browser on every change, so when you open it again all your data should still be there!

Remember, as a GM you have only two rules: 

1. Take notes. Anything generated or said may be needed later.
2. Make sure everyone, _including you_, is having fun.

## Player - Playing the game

I haven't personally been on this end of things, but will take notes when I run a campaign. Running one? Awesome! Make an issue and leave me some comments. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

This whole thing is still very much under maintenance. If something feels unbalanced, or weirdy, please leave me a note.
