# Welcome to Chromaforge!
A lightweight, no-planning, as-long-as-you-want D&D campaign.

This repository contains everything you need to run anything from a one-shot to a full campaign, short of dice. 

_If you're reading this and a file is mentioned but not linked, or missing, please open an issue, drop a comment, ping me on discord, or send me a message in some other way. Thank you for your help!_ :D

## Getting Started

Go through the /pre-game.md file, and get your game and characters setup. 

Character sheets are in /assets. 

You can print the character sheets or open up the html versions at <insert link>. It auto-saves to your browser on every change, so when you open it again all your data should still be there!

  Remember, as a GM you have only two rules: 
  1. Take notes. Everything is being generated on the fly and may/will be needed later.
  2. Make sure everyone, including you, is having fun.

## Playing the game - Player
  
  I haven't personally been on this end of things, but will take notes when I run a campaign. Running one? Awesome! Make an issue and leave me some comments and feedback. Any is greatly appreciated.

  This whole thing is still very much under maintenance. If something feels unbalanced, or weirdy, please leave me a note.
