# Preface
  Welcome to The Forge, a lightweight, on-the-fly, storytelling group thing!

# Part 1 - Character Creation

Unlike most roleplaying games, in The Forge you don't have to make many choices to get a character up and running. All it takes is two dice rolls and four choices and your whole character is created!

There are Races, Race Modifiers, Houses, and Classes. 
Race is the kind of creature you are: Human, Goblin, Centaur. 
Race Modifiers help create backstory to the character, as well as add some helpful modifiers.
House is the style of knowledge your Class falls under. You will have a main House and a secondary House. The secondary House is for character background and a few perks. 
Class you choose will dictate what kind of fighting you're good at (or not!).


**Requires:**
* 1d100
* 2d6

There are:
* 36 races
* 9 race modifiers
* 5 class houses
* 15 classes, 3 per house


## Chapter 1 - Step-By-Step Example

1. Rolls:
   * Race - 1d100: _42_
   * Class - 2d6: _1, 3_
2. Race
   1. _42_ falls in the 34 - 44 bracket
       * Human, Centaur, Hobbit, Troll
   2. Chosen **Centaur**
   3. Check modifiers:
      * 4: Flameborn  - Flameborn Centaur
      * 2: Exalted  - Exalted Centaur  
   4. Chosen **Flameborn**

      * Druid
      * Artificer 
   4. Chosen **Druid**
   5. Append secondary house:
       * Strong Druid
4. full character
   * _Strong Flameborn Druid Centaur_   



## Chapter 2 - Races & Race Modifiers

Races are divided into groupings of 4, within a 10 digit bracket. 
Roll a 1d100, and then check what bracket contains the number you rolled.

* 27: 23 - 33
* 84: 78 - 88
* 55: 45 - 55

Choose one of the four races in your bracket. You can check out the races document for extra information about your options to make a more informed decision, or just pick the top one if you're looking to generate a quick character.

Now, take the same roll and split it into its individual numbers. Those are your choices for Race Modifiers.

* 27: 2, 7

* 55: 5, 5

For a quick character you can ignore these altogether or just take the first digit.

1. aquatic - BLU
    * ARC+1
2. fel (dark-) - BLK
    * STL+1

    * CHR+1 
5. half-        
    * roll for a secondary race
6. studied
    *        
7. streetkin
    * 
8. careful
    * 
9. outgoing
    *  


## Chapter 3 - Houses & Classes

There are five Houses:
  * STR - Strength
  * STL - Stealth
  * ARC - Arcana
  * RAN - Range
  * CHR - Charm
  
Each House contains three Classes that showcase the House's skills.
Roll 2d6. If you got a 6, either roll again or choose one of the Houses manually.

1. Strength
2. Stealth
3. Arcana
4. Range
5. Charm
6. player's choice, or roll again

From the two rolls, choose which will be your Primary House and Secondary House. 
Now, choose a Class from your Primary House using the table below. 
Afterwards, prepend the Secondary House to your Class.

_Charming Artificer_

_Strong Thief_

_Ranged Beserker_


* **STR** _Strength_
  * barbarian
  * paladin
  * berserker

   
* **STL** _Stealth_
  * thief
  * monk
  * rogue


* **ARC** _Arcana_
  * sorcerer
  * druid
  * artificer


* **RAN** _Range_
  * card-thrower
  * hunter
  * archer

* **CHR** _charm_
  * bard
  * cleric
  * necromancer


### House Permanent Points

Whenever you level up, you can exchange 3XP for a House Permanent Point. These points are permanently added to your rolls whenever you do a skill check within that house.

## Chapter 4 - Personality & Background

Forge doesn't have built-in alignment charts, however now that you have your character built you can pick one if you'd like. 

## Chapter 5 - Equipment & Inventory

Inventory is simple: You have unlimited inventory slots, and can carry unlimited items or weight, _to a reasonable limit_. Your pack can't carry a whole dragon's gold stash, but you could feasibly use it to sneak a couple dragon eggs away from their clutch.

Equipment is much the same way as inventory. Sensible real-world logic and physics apply, unless there is a magical explanation.

# Part 2 - In-Game Mechanics

## Chapter 6 - Skill Checks

Whenever a player attempts an action that could change the course of history or the world around them, an appropriate Skill Check is used. Every check falls within one of the 5 Houses, however players can rationalize using one house as opposed to another.

Every skill check uses a 1d10, unless stated otherwise in the racial traits. In those cases, use the mentioned die.

For every three successful Skill Checks in one house you get one Experience Point towards that House.
These XP points cannot be allocated anywhere else except for this one House.  

Skill checks are used to progress as a character in the game
when a character goes to on a mission or quest, it can be difficult to succeed at harder tasks.
Skill checks give a chance to level up abilities.

Every race has a strong and weak house. An Orc may be really strong (STR) but not as charming with words (CHR).

Race-based strengths are used by giving a permanent +2 to any rolls within that House.
Class-based strengths are accounted for by giving a permanent +1 to any rolls in that House.
Weaknesses are accounted for by having a smaller die being rolled.


Every character attempting the skill check needs to roll the appropriate die for their character.
The DM will determine which house the check will be ran against, players may persuade the DM on using a different house for their personal check.


Checks grant Skill Check Points (sk) when successful. They require a minimum of the DC rolled, and fail if that roll cannot be achieved within the fail count. 

easy = 1sk
    DC:     3
    fails:  7

medium = 2sk
    DC:     5
    fails:  5
    
hard = 3sk
    DC:     7
    fails:  3

## Chapter 7 - Travel & Adventuring

## Chapter 8 - Combat

## Chapter 9 - Leveling Up

Any time you have three Skill Points (sk), you may exchange them for one Experience Point towards the house the checks were used towards.
After a long rest or before/after a session, you may convert any 3 House-specific XP into a House Permanent.

You may also convert any three XP into a Spirit Orb. These Orbs can be used as currency, or handed to other players/characters for them to use as experience. Be aware, one Spirit Orb will only give you one floating XP that you can add to any House, so there is a loss in the conversion.


   
at level 5, the world rolls against 
the player with 1d20 instead of 1d10

each class has a poor and very poor house. those houses are limited on the max level they can be raised to. 
poor maxes at level 7, very poor maxes at level 5. all other houses max out at level 10
