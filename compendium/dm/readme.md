welcome to the DM's guide. there will be more info here about all the bits you need to keep in mind. Forge was designed from the ground up to rely heavily on improvisation, so feel free to use (or not) any specific part of it. If something is not working quite right, or you don't understand it, please reach out so I can fix it or explain it better!

Thanks for playing my game \<3 \=)
