=========================

extra ideas

* sprouts of magic mushrooms, when touched give the person 
  full 10 on charm. the person actually has a -2 CHR for a few weeks.
* a giant's wooden croc shoe
* challenge stone. when someone picks it up, an engraving in red 
  gold letters appears, issuing a challenge relating to a random house. nothing happens if challenge is completed. 
* crater with tiny meteor in the middle
